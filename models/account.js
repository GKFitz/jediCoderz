// Datatypes, Sequelize 
// WHERE DOES THE LINK TO THE ORM GO??? FOR BOTH DOG.JS & ACCOUNT.JS?
// index.js file would hold the general sequelize data but what about for dogs and accounts?
// should belong to a Dog / Admin / - TBD... division b/w accounts table and dogs table

// TWO ORM FILES ************
// must connect to the ORM file at some point
const orm = require('../config/orm.js');

// checked previous examples... seems like HTTPS requests must apply here
const account = {
    // all
    // create
    // update
    // delete 
}

module.exports = account;

# Project 2: Dog House 

# Live Link At:

# Description 

As dog owners and enthusiast ourselves, we know the importance of meeting the special needs of our beloved companions. When we can’t be with our dogs whether it be, a few hours at home alone, or in a relatives care, there’s always that little worry in the back of our minds.
That’s why we developed Dog House, a place that connects dog owners with dog boarders to help facilitate better communication on what each client needs. 
With Dog House, we hope to aid boarding facilities in meeting the needs of the listed boarding opportunities and showcasing their professionalism.
